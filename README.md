# Stock_Trend_Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the trend of stock prices (up or down) using historical market data and machine learning techniques. By analyzing past stock performance and generating technical indicators, we train models to forecast whether the price will go up or down on the next day. 
The notebook includes:

📥 Fetching historical stock data using yfinance

🛠️ Feature engineering with lag values, returns, and moving averages

🤖 Model training using Logistic Regression and Random Forest

📈 Performance analysis with accuracy scores, confusion matrix, and visualizations

The aim is to give a basic yet practical insight into how ML can be applied for trend prediction in the stock market. This is not financial advice—just a technical implementation for educational purposes.
